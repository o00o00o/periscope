            <p><b class="b-about"> Steven Luo </b > is a second year student at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Electrical Engineering with a Software Engineering option. As an outspoken member of the Waterloo Engineering Society, Steven is serving as Webmaster and was the ECE Class Representative. Due to his communication skills and dedication, Steven was selected to present a Lighting Talk at the FYIC conference at Ryerson University hosted by ESSCO (Engineering Student Socieities Council of Ontario) as a Waterloo delegate. Steven wants to set an example of how learning is a balance between inside and outside of the classroom. </p>
            <p> As an aspiring engineer, Steven understands the difference between verification and validation. As verification in the form of exams are common, Steven takes initiative to find every opportunity to validate/battle-harden his skills. A small list of accomplishments include: second place finish at Protohack Vancouver 2016, third place finish at Waterloo Google Games 2016, and first place heat at UBC Physics Olympics 2015. Expereinces such as analyzing data directly from the CERN Super Collider at TRIUMF to NASA hosted hackathons are the norm. </p>

            <p> Steven is a person who will add value to any team, through his witty sense of humour, featuring self deprecating jokes, or ability to perform problem decomposition in any situation. His attention to detail and work ethic have been honed through years of menial jobs. When Steven is lucky enough to have free time you can find him trying to achieve a sub-seventeen 5 km run or practising his side spin in table tennis. Other specs of Steven 19.04 LTS includes becoming the next Jascha Heifetz (violin), Lucas Etter (Rubik’s cube), and Bill P. (bubble tea connoisseur). </p>

            <p> Steven, as part of the Waterloo ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) team, is embracing “The Internet of Things”. Current projects include a mood analyzing nightlight and PCB design for LED matrix Tetris. Overflowing with ambition, Steven takes every opportunity to develop himself; he hopes he won't fall prey to hamartia unlike the tragic hero Macbeth.  </p>
