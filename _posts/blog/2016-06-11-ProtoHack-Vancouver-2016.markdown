This day a lot of firsts happened for my longtime friend, Chris (UBC Engineering). First time at a hackathon, drinking coffee, pretending to be a girl (I hope), and going to karaoke. The only second, was the amazing second place finish.

This is also the first time that Chris, Jessica (Western AEO), and I have worked together on the same team. We were a little bit rag-tagged, but having known each other for a long time I think we each had a feeling that this would be a good team. The hackathon was at a Coding school called Launch Academy in the heart of Yaletown. This hackathon was sponsored by Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation (CBCF), and our goal was to use technology in order to raise awareness for young women to conduct self-checks for breast cancer. As an unaware male, I myself did not know of such an issue, but after a heart tugging presentation by Sarah Albrecht CBCF executive I was ready to rock and roll. This is the first time that I have put my technological skills to use that would serve a greater purpose, needless to say I was very excited.

After a heated brain storming session with many cheap shots taken at me my Jessica, we had ironed out a project plan that involved three aspects working together. Number one is a partnership, with the massive lingerie company Victoria Secret. They would help with advertising, handing out stress balls, and coupon codes. Part two is the stress balls, these balls will vibrate and light up every 3 weeks as a gentle reminder to perform a check. They will also feature different textures that mimic symptoms of breast cancer that need to be checked for. We feel that by having these physical balls, it has a catalyzing effect, as people will wonder what they are for and why they are lighting up. Lastly within the balls there will be a built in NFC tag which brings us to the last aspect of the project, the mobile webapp. This began our social media and technological aspect of the project. The webapp features a “fellow squeezers” where it mapped other people who have the squeeze balls. It allows users to feel that they are part of the bigger movement. The webapp also had all the information needed to conduct a check and additional resources such as a direct link to find the nearest mammogram.

Our team worked well with each other; what made us successful was the fact that we were able to be completely blunt to each other and ask for exactly what we wanted. There was no ego on the line, nor office politics, it was simply “GIT shit done.” With a solid business plan and flawless prototype, our unique take on the pitch had the judges laughing. Chris played you average working female doing some shopping at Victoria Secret while Jessica and I voiced over how this awareness movement will start and impact Chris’ life. A comment I had from a fellow hacker was that this could have been the next “Ice Bucket Challenge!” It was a heated final presentation and by the narrowest margin we finished second place. It was extremely fun and a jammed packed day, I’ve never had so much fun listening to all the other presentation. I felt that we really did something good for the world that day as our ideas will be consider or incorporated with an actual campaign by the CBCF! I just again want to thank my team, loved working with you guys and oh Chris you’re pretty decent for karaoke eh? Is there something you’ve been hiding from me?
