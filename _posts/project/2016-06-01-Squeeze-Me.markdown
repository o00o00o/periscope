**Learning:**

The most important thing I learned while working on this project is to look at the bigger picture. Being the most technical guy on the team, I was only focusing on implementing the features of the app. This project has taught me that how the business/media plan will work together with the launching a successful app is just as important. As a developer I need to keep in mind how to integrate the application into the overall campaign and the needs of other team member who maybe are more focused on other things such as matching the poster or creating a live demo for the pitch.

**Description:**

Please refer to the in-depth [blog](http://www.swluo.me/blog/competition/hackathon/teamwork/coding/problem%20solving/ProtoHack-Vancouver-2016) about the business plan behind the web app itself. This web app is the heart of the campaign which fulfills two goals. One is to provide accurate information as well as answer frequently asked question regarding “self checks.” Second is our attempt to make our social media campaign “fellow squeezer." Our campaign with “fellow squeezers” is unique in that it shows the geographical location of its members. It is different from the hundreds of Facebook “likes” which is unrelatable. The idea is to show the bigger picture of the movement and to get more people on board. This project resulted in a second place finish.

**Feature list:**

* Ability to set re-occurring reminders (notification and in-coming text messages)
* Self-check instructions
* Frequently asked questions about breast cancer
* Fellow Squeezers (mapped location of other campaign participants)
* Ability to easily get more help or make an appointment for a mammogram
* Donate button directly to Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation

**Thought process:**

Due to the lack of time we used a prototyping tool to create this web app. Our web app is focused on the user interface and the user experience. In order to gain users, we wanted this app to be the least intrusive as possible. We know users don’t like to download “stuff” onto their phones so a web app that requires no downloads was the perfect solution. The ability to set a reoccurring alarm that will text you is a feature that will be extremely helpful.

**Challenge:**

Some difficulty with this project is working with the prototyping tool. This is the same tool that companies like Netflix uses. As not everyone is a coder, this is an awesome way of letting a designer give an exact idea for developers to implement. After “figuring out” the tool by playing around and reading documentation. Putting everything together and making it look good was not too difficult. It’s hard to tell that the project is a prototype, but this made the tool extremely rewarding.
