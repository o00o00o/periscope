**Please check out my [blog](http://www.swluo.me/blog/nasa/hackathon/teamwork/coding/problem%20solving/Nasa-Space-Apps-2016) for an in-depth look into this project.**

**Learning:**

There are two important things I’ve learned on this project. One is how to work with google play services and android permissions. This was extremely important and had shifted my thinking about the issue of personal privacy. Again please take a look at my blog for my explanation of this fact. The second thing I’ve learned is how calculus applies to the real world. I could not have imagined having to use the calculus outside of classroom. We learned so many different techniques to integrate and accurately model functions but until this project I saw no application.


**Description:**

The challenge here is to create a tool to visually compare NASA flight data of a sonic boom to a low boom. A sonic boom is when an aircraft travels at a speed that is faster than the speed of sound. This results in a shockwave that follows the aircraft. This shockwave of energy is capable of shattering windows and causing hearing loss. A low boom is created by an aircraft that is specifically created to minimize the effects a shockwave. This is important as it will allow commercial supersonic flights across the continent. Traveling home for Christmas would be much easier.

**Features:**

* Google maps API to find current location
* Graphical overlay of sonic boom or low boom
* Sound effect of a sonic boom
* Animation of aircraft flying across the screen

**Thought Process:**

Our android app uses Google maps Api to map your location as well as draw an overlay of the affected area. As a shock wave radiate out of the aircraft as a sphere (volume) we wanted the affected area on the surface (area). Thankfully fellow a team member and I had just completed ECE-119 which gave us the multivariate calculus needed to find our area.

**Challenge:**

The challenge of this project was working with raw data from NASA. Raw data is hard to work with as there is no context. We have a bunch of numbers and don’t know what to do with them. We need to find a useful pattern for ourselves. This was extremely difficult as most data that we’re used to are ones that are spoon fed to us. To overcome this challenge, the team took a good amount of time just looking and analyzing the data together. Once we got an idea of what we’re looking at the project gets slightly easier.
