**Learn:**

How to work with sequential logic in order to make something useful. I learned how to apply all the tools I learned in digital circuits to the “real world.” In our digital circuits course we learned how to use logic gates to implement functions. Then using K-maps to simplify these functions, and then created them in a different medium. This was extremely cool as it was akin to creating the first computer in a new world.


**Description:**

An 8-bit calculator implemented in the Minecraft world using Redstone. This project used 10,000 blocks and took a long time to create. I played Minecraft when it first released and it was extremely fun coming building on the platform. The point of this project was just a creative way to implement some of the logic we have learned in class.

**Challenge:**

The biggest challenge of this project is working with the Redstone. There are a lot of big drawbacks such as wires cannot be directly above each other, cannot be adjacent to each other, and also only has a range of 15 blocks from a source. This made debugging very difficult but with time and attention to detail I was able to over come this challenge.
