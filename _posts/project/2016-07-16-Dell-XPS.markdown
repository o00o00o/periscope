This is a collection of extremely useful bash scripts for the Dell XPS 13 running Ubuntu 15.04 + 16.04. There are a few known issues and these scripts make life a lot easier.

1. backlight.sh automatically turns off the backlight on the Dell XPS. By default the backlight is on at full brightness on start up. It is recommended to run this script on start up by adding it to rc.local

2. bluetooth.sh blocks the bluetooth device driver using rfkill. Again recommending running at startup as bluetooth is on by default

3. wifi.sh resets the wifi connection by reseting the wifi drivers. In my experience with the XPS there are issues with connecting to public wifi locations or connection cutting out. This is extremely convenient and helpful.

4. audio.sh kills the pulseaudio (restart automatically) and also resets the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ASLA). I have experiences where my headphones would not be detected at all and this script really helps.
